# The SMRK Hamiltonian and Explicit Formulae

## Overview

This document establishes the **explicit formula interface** of the SMRK Hamiltonian.
Classical explicit formulas are reinterpreted as **renormalized trace identities**
of a self-adjoint arithmetic operator.

The emphasis is structural, not heuristic.

---

## Main Results

- Construction of trace objects from the SMRK Hamiltonian
- Derivation of prime–spectral dual expansions
- Identification of generalized von Mangoldt weights
- Controlled treatment of divergences
- Explicit falsification criteria

---

## Conceptual Shift

The explicit formula is not taken as a starting axiom.

Instead:
- arithmetic and spectral sides arise from the same trace object,
- primes and zeros are dual expansions,
- renormalization is universal and operator-driven.

## What This Paper Does NOT Do

- It does not assume RH
- It does not prove RH
- It does not rely on heuristic cancellations

---

## Status

**Rigorous formal derivation + falsifiable structure.**

---

## Relation to Other Documents

- Builds directly on:
  - SMRK Hamiltonian
  - Self-adjoint realization
- Prepares:
  - Trace conjectures
  - General L-function extensions

---

## Intended Audience

- Analytic number theorists
- Spectral theorists
- Researchers working with explicit formulas
